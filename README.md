120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results
Basic bio data on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including the games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 (120 years of Olympic history). This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions on how Olympics have  evolved over time for female, analysis about the participation and performance of athletes and a detailed analysis about the countries that have highest number of participants and medals.

Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.
